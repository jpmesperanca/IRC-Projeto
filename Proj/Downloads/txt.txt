I'll pile on the candy,
It's such a pretty sight
It makes the food taste dandy
But my tummy hurts all night
I'll put in some ingredients
But keep the rest for me
I'm not just disobedient
I'm careful, can't you see?
It's a piece of cake to bake a pretty cake
If the way is hazy,
You gotta do the cooking by the book
You know you can't be lazy
Never use a messy recipe,
The cake will end up crazy
If you do the cooking by the book,
Then you'll have a cake
We gotta have it made,
You know that I love cake
Finally, it's time to make a cake!
Making food is just like science,
With tools that blend and baste
And every fun appliance
Gives the food a different taste!
